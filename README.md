# HackerTree
A "skill tree" for learning how to code.

## Concept
Learning how to code can be challenging and long-winded. Although there are
some truly great resources out there, they are scattered and often missing a thread.

### Learn by Coding
Although we realize that there is nothing more practical than solid theory,
we also know from our own experience that learning how to code is best done by
coding - and that's why we want to get people to work on projects early in their
learning process.

### Choose Your Own Adventure
We also realize that different people are driven by different things, which is
why - except for a very minimal "Beginners' Track" - every track will be modular.

### Work on Your Own Pace
Even when getting into a huge project like learning how to code, the commitment
a learner has to make should be minimal in order to keep the course accessible.
Learners should always be able to assess their skill level quickly - every lesson
should be followed by a test the learner can take.

### Share Your Results
In order to enable learners to contribute to open-source projects, they should
be encouraged to collaborate and share their results publicly. 

## Structure

### Beginners' Track
The Beginners' track should be kept minimal (i.e. not more than 3 lessons of 90 
minutes). Every lesson in the Beginners' Track should be able to stand on its 
own: It should teach something practical that is relevant to the learner.

### Projects
After an introduction to vital tools and concepts via the Beginners' Track, the
learner should be encouraged to work on projects relevant to them.

Ideally, a project teaches the learner a new concept (or at least a new aspect 
of a concept).

Some more advanced projects require the learner to be comfortable with other
concepts, ideally taught by other projects. Each project should have a list 
of other projects required to successfully complete it.

Projects should focus on teaching exactly one new concept. A project should 
take the learner abut 90 to 150 minutes to complete. Concepts that can not
be taught in 90 minutes should be split up in smaller chunks.

## How to Contribute

When contributing, please keep in mind that the project is at a conceptual 
stage. Currently, we are collecting ideas and resources, not building a
platform.

If you want to add your ideas to the corresponding folder, using templates
if one is in place.
